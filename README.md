# Netflix Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a Netflix dataset containing **7,789 records** and **11 columns**, including details about Movies and TV Shows such as title, director, cast, country, release date, rating, duration, and type. The goal is to uncover **content trends** over the years, identify popular genres, and analyze country-wise contributions. This analysis provides **strategic insights** for content acquisition and production.

## Problem Statement
Netflix is a global streaming platform facing competition from Amazon Prime, Disney+, and regional OTT services. The problem addressed in this project is understanding how **content distribution (Movies vs. TV Shows, genres, countries)** has evolved. The analysis aims to identify key genres, audience preferences, and provide recommendations for global content expansion.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows over the years.
- Identify the most common genres and how their popularity has changed.
- Compare country-wise contributions to Netflix’s catalog.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for development and documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- `Title`, `Director`, `Cast`, `Country`, `Date_Added`, `Release_Year`, `Rating`, `Duration`, `Type`, `Genres`

## Source Code
The main analysis is performed in a **Jupyter Notebook** with Python. Visualizations include distribution of content types, top countries, genre trends, and content added over the years.
